# iot-gps-app
IoT app/widget that periodically captures GPS coordinates and streams to a backend for storage and display on a map.

## Objectives

The objectives of the project are to demonstrate the following:

* Solve a problem with very little information available
* Ability to pick up basic technical skills fast
* Quickly determine relevant technical tools to use.

## Project description

* Write a software program for a mobile device that will capture the Longitude & Latitude GPS coordinates at 1 second intervals. (Any mobile platform is acceptable i.e., IOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)
* Take this stream of data and push it to a backend service where it is saved.
* Create a widget on the backend service to display the GPS data on a map.

## Pointers

*  ThingsBoard as a backend solution.
